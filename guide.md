# Sign-up Guide

## Qualification
If you live in the Garfield neighborhood, you qualify. Trees should be planted in the right of way between the street and your sidewalk. If you do not have a right of way, you may plant a tree as close to the sidewalk as possible.

Do you rent and want to participate? Send this information to your landlord; if the sidewalk is in the Garfield Neighborhood we're happy to help put a tree over it!

Trees may be picked up on November 2, 2019 at the building located at 123 E Garfield St. between 12am to 11:59pm.

In general, trees should be watered every day for the first two weeks after planting and twice a week after that for at least six (6) months. Trees may require special needs beyond these guidelines. For more information about tree care, please visit the link below:

## Owner responsibility
By requesting free trees you are agreeing to water the donated tree(s). You agree to water the tree(s) every day for the first two weeks after planting and twice a week after that for at least 6 months, or otherwise in accordance with the requirements for the tree species. You also agree to trim the tree(s) regularly to avoid growth that blocks the sidewalk and street.
