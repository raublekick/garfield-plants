## What is the Garfield tree planting initiative?
Garfield Neighborhood and the Sikh Community are teaming up to plant two hundred FREE TREES to help build a pedestrian canopy in our neighborhood.

## Who is eligible for free trees?
Anyone who owns property in the Garfield neighborhood which has space to plant the trees by the sidewalk. Trees must be planted in the right-of-way between the sidewalk and the street if that’s big enough, otherwise in the yard right next to the sidewalk. If you rent, please let your landlord know about this opportunity!

* Monday, October 14th - Monday, October 21st: contact 811 AZ Blue Stake
* Saturday, October 26th from 7am - Noon: Trees available for pickup
